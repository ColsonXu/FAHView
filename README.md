## :hammer: Current Build
At the moment, this script is hard coded to work with my system setup only. Temperature values and folding progress will show up for any system with one CPU of any brand and two Nvidia GPUs. However, names of those device will likely be off.

## :pill: TO-DO
* Overall touch-up with formatting and color scheme.
* Display donor name, team name, and ranks.
* Dynamic coding ensuring cross-system compatibility.
* Combining the two files into one.
* Exceptions Handling.
* Compile and package into proper command.:package:
